ggResidpanel is an R package Katie Rey and I developed for creating panels of diagnostic plots for residuals from a model using ggplot2. It also allows for the creation of interactive versions of the plots using plotly. 

The package has recently been released on CRAN! An overview of the package can be found at this [website](https://goodekat.github.io/ggResidpanel/). The source code can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/goodekat/ggResidpanel).

Here is an example panel of diagnostic plots created using ggResidpanel.

```{r message = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
# Fit a linear model
lm_model1 <- lm(Volume ~ Girth, data = trees)

# Use the resid_panel function from ggResidpanel to create a panel of diagnostics plots
ggResidpanel::resid_panel(lm_model1)
```
