I am working on my PhD in statistics at [Iowa State University](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/). I received a bachelor's degrees in mathematics from Lawrence University and an MS in statistics from UW Madison. I currently work as an [AES statistical consultant](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/statistical-consulting) for the statistics department. I am interested in assessing and diagnosing models, random forests, data visualization, developing tools for statistical analyses, design of experiments, and statistical consulting.

Here is a picture of me with my family's dog. Her name is Nova.
