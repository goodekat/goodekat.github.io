    "text": "Speed presentation and e-poster for JSM 2019\nRandom forests are known for their accurate predictive abilities, but they are a part of the family of machine learning models that lack interpretability. A technique called LIME was developed to provide local interpretations for predictive models. The technique fits a ridge regression model to binary encoded perturbations created from the observed data weighted by proximity to the prediction of interest. The predicted values associated with the perturbations computed using the complex model are used as the response variable in the regression. The coefficients from the linear model are then used to determine the influential variables. We have developed some visualizations and other diagnostic tools to assess the explanations produced by LIME from a random forest. In particular, we consider how well the simple model fit by LIME captures the random forest model and how the results from LIME vary based on different algorithm input options. To demonstrate these tools, we apply LIME to a random forest fit to a forensics bullet matching dataset using the lime R package and apply our methods to diagnose the LIME explanations.\nSlides Poster GitHub"

Recently, a technique called LIME was developed to provide local interpretations for complex predictive models. LIME determines which variables are important in a prediction of interest by fitting a local linear regression to model predictions and perturbations of the data. The coefficients from the linear model are used to interpret the complex model. While applying LIME to random forests, I encountered some unusual results.

    "text": "Talk for ISU Graphics Group.\nThe fish species of Grass Carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), and Bighead Carp (H. nobilis) are categorized as invasive carp in North America. There is interest from a natural resource management perspective to monitor the populations and spread of the fish species. A common monitoring practice is to collect and genetically identify fish eggs, but this process is both costly in money and time. Camacho et al. (2019) demonstrated the use of machine learning as a possibility for a more efficient method of identifying invasive carp. Camacho et al. (2019) trained random forests on easy to measure egg characteristics such as water conductivity and average membrane diameter, and the models returned high accuracy.\nIn this talk, I will present my recent work with Dr. Michael Weber (NREM) and Dr. Philip Dixon on a Shiny app (WhoseEgg) for identifying invasive carp using random forests based on those from Camacho et al. (2019). The app is intended to be a tool for researchers to input their own fish egg data and easily obtain random forest predictions via a point-and-click user interface. We began work on the app in January, so it is still in development. I will share the current state of the app and our goals for enhancement. I will also ask the audience for feedback. We would greatly appreciate suggestions for adjustments to make the app more user friendly.\nSlides GitHub"

    "text": "Talk for AAAI 2020 Fall Symposium on AI in the Government and Public Sector\nOptical spectral-temporal signatures extracted from videos of explosions provide information for identifying characteristics of the corresponding explosive devices. Currently, the identification is done using heuristic algorithms and direct subject matter expert review. An improvement in predictive performance may be obtained by using machine learning, but this application lends itself to high consequence national security decisions, so it is not only important to provide high accuracy but clear explanations for the predictions to garner confidence in the model. While much work has been done to develop explainability methods for machine learning models, not much of the work focuses on situations with input variables of the form of functional data such optical spectral-temporal signatures. We propose a procedure for explaining machine learning models fit using functional data that accounts for the functional nature the data. Our approach makes use of functional principal component analysis (fPCA) and permutation feature importance (PFI). fPCA is used to transform the functions to create uncorrelated functional principal components (fPCs). The model is trained using the fPCs as inputs, and PFI is applied to identify the fPCs important to the model for prediction. Visualizations are used to interpret the variability explained by the fPCs that are found to be important by PFI to determine the aspects of the functions that are important for prediction. We demonstrate the technique by explaining neural networks fit to explosion optical spectral-temporal signatures for predicting characteristics of the explosive devices.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.

As a statistical consultant for researchers in many areas, I often find myself reminding my clients to visualize residuals to assess model assumptions. Many of my clients are working with mixed models, and I recently realized that I often recommend the use of certain residual types without a full understanding of the implications of selecting one type over another. This led me to have an interest in better understanding the many residuals types for mixed model. In this talk, I will provide a review of the residual types available for linear mixed models (marginal, conditional, studentized, etc.). I will explain how the residuals are computed and how these computations differ between R and SAS. I will also discuss what I have learned from the literature about how to select a residual type when assessing a model. Lastly, I will briefly touch on residual types for generalized linear mixed models and list some unanswered questions. If time permits, I will pose these remaining questions to the attendees to discuss as a group.\nSlides GitHub"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Talk for ISU Graphics Group.\nRandom forests are a popular method for statistical applications with an objective of prediction. While an individual tree within a random forest provides a clear decision path for how a prediction is made, the ensemble of trees from the forest creates a complex decision process that is difficult to interpret. One approach used to gain insight into this decision process is visualization of the model. Various approaches have been taken to visualize random forests including trace plots developed by Simon Urbanek (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-33037-0_11). Trace plots depict the trees in a random forest using a structure similar to parallel coordinate plots that allows for a direct comparison of the trees. In this talk, I’ll describe trace plots and discuss my recent work on implementing and extending trace plots in R. I’ll also discuss my attempts to use trace plots to compare variability between clusters of trees in a random forest and visualizing representative or summary trees in the context of tree variability.\nSlides GitHub"

    "text": "Talk given to the statistics department at Sandia National Laboratories\nA desire to be able to interpret machine learning models has led to an area of research focused on providing explanations for predictions made by black-box models. One method that has resulted from this area of research is LIME (Ribeiro et. al. 2016). LIME stands for local interpretable model-agnostic explanations. The method provides an explanation for a black box prediction by using an interpretable model, referred to as an explainer model, to approximate the complex black-box model in a local region around a prediction of interest. The quality of the explanation produced by LIME will depend on how good of an approximation the interpretable model is to the complex model. Currently, few tools have been provided to assess this approximation. We are developing visualizations that diagnose the explanation produced by LIME. In this talk, I will provide a brief overview of LIME, motivate the importance of the assessing LIME explanations, and introduce our diagnostic visualizations.\nSlides GitHub"
