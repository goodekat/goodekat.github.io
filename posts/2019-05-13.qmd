Random forests are known for their accurate predictive abilities, but they are a part of the family of machine learning models that lack interpretability. Recently, a technique called LIME was developed to provide local interpretations for complex predictive models. LIME determines which variables are important in a prediction of interest by fitting a local linear regression to model predictions and perturbations of the data. The coefficients from the linear model are used to interpret the complex model. While applying LIME to random forests, I encountered some unusual results. This led me to develop some diagnostic tools to evaluate LIME. I will demonstrate these by assessing the application of LIME to a random forest fit to a forensics bullet matching dataset.
