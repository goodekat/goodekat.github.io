Random forests have become a popular tool for data driven predictions and, as a result, are used, or considered for use, in national security mission applications. While individual regression/decision trees are typically considered interpretable, random forests are inherently difficult to interpret due to their ensemble of trees. A lack of model transparency may be less than desirable in high-consequence applications. We aim to increase the interpretability of random forests by finding patterns in the ensemble of trees. As a starting point, we develop a new distance metric for quantifying the similarity between trees based on their topologies (i.e., shapes). We base the metric on a novel distance metric for graphs that is a proper mathematical distance, is invariant to transformations, has registration between graphs, and computes topological evolutions between graphs. The tree distance metric enables computations of tree statistics (e.g., a “mean” tree) and identification of tree clusters. We apply the developed methodology to a toy dataset and a mission relevant product inspection dataset, which demonstrates how the metric provides insight into random forests. Furthermore, we discuss limitations of the approach and ideas for future research.
